# Python Weather App

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

## App Description

Here is a simple weather app which uses Python üêç for the backend and Flask üå∂ for the frontend!\
I listed out the basic functionality this app has.

1. Display the weather of user's current location.\

2. Display the weather forecast of that location for the next 7 days
3. Let you check the weather of different regions in Japan.

Although it's originally designed for mobile devices, the app is full responsive!\
Here are some captures of the app on desktop view.

## Tech Stack

I used Flask for generate HTML templates. Python takes care of setting up a server, routing and making calls to the Open Weather API.\

**Frontend**: Flask, SASS\
